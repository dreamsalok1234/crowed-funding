        <h2>Macro rational - CHART</h2>
        <h4>The reality of most investments is they are often </h4>
        <h5>To complex, To cash intensive, To risky</h5>
        <p>None of the above 3 are appealing to any one parting with their own funds, and what seems to be the grim
          reality is that the investments with the most stability and longevity (usually real estate) are impossible to
          obtain for the majority of us.</p>
        <p>Everyone wants to sleep soundly that what they had at 10 pm is still available and even a little more at 8
          am , and the history of our fiscal world teaches us that this is on the whole the most likely with real
          estate. And for the fortunate people of our country that is even more the case then the rest of Europe and
          even the world. So macro factors display that to be able to invest in Switzerland is to be fortunate.</p>

          <h2>CO-OWNERSHIP CONCEPT</h2>
          <p>Real estates which we are offering are existing with all required instrastructure rental buldings. When you make a decision about investment and buy shares, your name is entered in the land registry together with all the other co-owners. During the holding period, each co-owner collects the net rental income which is based on participation. When the property is sold, co-owners make additional profit. The holding period of this type of investment is usually seven years.</p>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>

ALL REQUIRED INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXIST - Co-owners have nothing to worry about and make additional efforts to make their building functional. We have great cooperation with long standing brands, so the quality of your investment is not compromised.</p>
		<h2> THE SUM OF THE WHOLE IS WORTH MORE THAN ITS PARTS </h2>
		<p>Innovative exit philosophy  that allows you to play like the large institutions , all holders sign an agreement which states that if the exit value on year 5 once combined with preexisting real estate and future real-estate allows for a 15 % uplift on capital then everyone sells</p>
        <ul class="check-icon">
          <li><strong><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></strong>Preexisting real estate</li>
          <li><strong><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></strong>Streamlined costs so benefits passed on</li>
          <li><strong><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> </strong>Experience</li>
          <li><strong><i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></strong>Lower entry point</li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>ROE</h2>
        <p>The ROE is key return on equity at Kreis wealth the ROE is not a maybe it’s an insured agreement producing flat 5 % ROE paid quarterly in arrears , the whole Kreis Invest philosophy is the streamline and simplify making as much use of technology as possible without losing the personal touch.  The benefit of the return being locked in is simple ok it’s not 6 % but it also not 3 %.</p>
        <p>The longer term strategy is for the sum of the parts philosophy to benefit from current stock preexisting stock and the substantive pipeline that we already own , and for all the individual owners to benefit from CRYTICAL MASS  something that so far as only been available to the elite.  </p>
